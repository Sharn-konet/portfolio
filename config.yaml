      I want to make software and visualisations that surprise people.

      Whether it's a Machine Learning system that gives a surprisingly good prediction, or a dashboard that uncovers a new perspective,
      I want people to question their understanding of the problems around us.

      I'm an Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) graduate from the University of Auckland specialising in Engineering Science.
      My studies focused on software development, optimisation, and mathematical modelling of real-world systems.

  #     As a kid, I was always interested in mathematics and everything tech.
  #     I pursued that interest as far as I could, and it guided me toward an education in Engineering Science at the University of Auckland.

  #     Along the way, I discovered photography and cinematography as outlets for creativity. Throughout my secondary education I took part
  #     in many competitions.
