# Sharn-Konet's Portfolio Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b9d15ba3-f4cd-47c3-9607-1fc547326b63/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sharnkonet-portfolio/deploys)

This is the source code for my portfolio website which I made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

You can see it in action by going to [sharnko.net](https://sharnko.net)

The website is made completely from scratch. Initially I started with Hugo and AWS Lightsail. I soon got frustrated with how little I could change the aesthetic of any given Hugo theme, and instead decided to learn how to do front-end development.

I chose Svelte because of it's modularity. I could easily develop and focus on individual sections of my portfolio, then let Svelte combine them all together through compilation.

I switched to Netlify because AWS Lightsail only caters for static websites, and I wanted to include some dynamic elements now that I was writing the code myself. Netlify seemed like the best alternative as it had a supported adapter maintained by the Svelte team. This meant I could create my website however I wanted locally, and it would translate directly to the website I'd see under my domain.

## Projects

The projects section of the website is meant to be a place to house all of my projects so that they are publically accessible. This means rather than having to run some source code, people can just interact with them online.

At the moment, this section is empty while I figure out the best way to integrate compute resources into the website.

## Gallery

The gallery is a place for me to upload all of my photos so that if people are interested in my photography, I can direct them to one place.
