<h1>Sharn-Konet Reitsma</h1>
<h2>Data Scientist</h2>

<p>
I want to make software and visualisations that surprise people.

Whether it's a Machine Learning system that gives a surprisingly good prediction, or a dashboard that uncovers a new perspective,
I want people to question their understanding of the problems around us.

I'm a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) graduate from the University of Auckland specialising in Engineering Science.
My studies focused on software development, optimisation, and mathematical modelling of real-world systems.
