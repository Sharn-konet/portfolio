<h1>Experience</h1>

    <h2>Data Scientist Graduate at <strong>Xero</strong></h2>
    <p>
        In the graduate program at Xero I rotated through multiple disciplines.

        As a Data Applications Engineer I was learning to serve production-ready Machine Learning systems. I also got to work on develop internal tooling for orchestrating complex data pipelines.

        As an Applied Scientist I was engaged in developing better predictions for Bank Reconciliation. This gave me the opportunity to experience how experiments are conducted in large organisations improving existing products.

        As a Data Enrichment Engineer, I implemented business logic using the Data Vault 2.0 modelling standard. I also worked on making the build process more efficient for existing models."""

    <h2>AI Software Developer at Spark 64</h2>
    <p>
        Through my internship at ElementX, previously Spark64, I gained the opportunity to branch out from analytics and develop AI solutions for a wide range of areas. During this internship I took on the responsibility of developing computer vision solutions for optical character recognition, object recognition and audio event detection.

    <h2>Research Assistant</h2>

    <h2>Data Scientist Intern at <strong>Harmonic Analytics</strong></h2>
    <p>
        My internship at Harmonic was my first exposure to analytics and optimisation in a professional environment. I primarily worked as a contractor for Watercare which involved analytics of wastewater overflow, and application of computer vision to asset management.
